/**
 * Lecithin: hand a console-sender {@code Bukkit.dispatchCommand} back to the region that sender
 * belongs to, instead of refusing it where it was called.
 *
 * <h2>The gap, in its exact shape</h2>
 * Folia's {@code CraftServer.dispatchCommand} branches on the <b>sender</b>: an {@code Entity}
 * sender requires that entity's region thread, and a console / RCON sender requires the global
 * region. So {@code dispatchCommand(player, ...)} from that player's own event handler is already
 * legal and was measured legal - the 4x4 sender x context matrix has
 * {@code C1 player region x S1 player sender = ACCEPTED returned=true}.
 *
 * <p>What is <i>not</i> legal is the other one: a plugin handling a player event (region thread)
 * dispatching a command <b>as the console</b>, which is how reward commands are almost always
 * written. That throws out of the event handler, and everything after the dispatch line is skipped.
 * Measured on this server: LycoQuest's reward grant failed 7/7 that way.
 *
 * <h2>Why the global region here is not "route anything to the global scheduler"</h2>
 * Hard boundary 4 / {@code DEC-19} B2 forbids sending <i>arbitrary</i> sync work to the global
 * scheduler, because the owner would be a guess and the failure would move from load time to a
 * random point at run time. Neither applies here:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The owner is not inferred. {@code RegionizedServer.ensureGlobalTickThread} on the line
 *       below this one is the platform stating, in its own code, that the global region is where a
 *       console sender executes. This class sends it exactly there.</li>
 *   <li>Nothing about the work changes context. The command runs in the one place stock Folia
 *       already demands for this sender, so a command that reaches into a region it does not own
 *       fails at that access, loudly, exactly as it would have.</li>
 *   <li>It is not "all commands". An {@code Entity} sender is untouched - stock Folia's check still
 *       runs, and it still throws, because for an entity sender the honest owner is that entity's
 *       region and a caller on the wrong entity's region is a real mistake worth reporting.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What survives and what does not</h2>
 * The synchronous {@code boolean} is <b>half</b> preserved, and the preserved half is the only half
 * Paper ever varied: {@code false} means "no such command", decided by the parse, and {@code true}
 * means "handed off for execution". So the parse still happens on the calling thread and a
 * {@code false} still comes back verbatim; only the execution is deferred, and it always reports
 * {@code true}, which is what Paper reports for every command that exists.
 *
 * <p>Parsing on a region thread is not a new exposure. {@code Commands} guards the dispatcher with
 * no thread check of any kind, {@code parse} is a read-only walk of the Brigadier tree, and
 * {@code VanillaCommandWrapper.tabComplete} does this same {@code getListener} + {@code parse} pair
 * off the global thread today. Building the console source stack reads the server-level respawn
 * dimension and position ({@code MinecraftServer.createCommandSourceStack}), not chunk or block
 * state, so no ownership check is on that path.
 *
 * <p><b>Not preserved, and not papered over:</b> an exception thrown while the command executes no
 * longer propagates out of the {@code dispatchCommand} call - it surfaces on the global region, on a
 * later tick. A caller that wrapped the dispatch in {@code try/catch} will no longer see it. In this
 * plugin set that changes nothing observable (of 62 dispatch callsites, 57 discard the return value
 * outright and the only real branch on it is in a BungeeCord proxy class the server never loads),
 * but the semantics did change and callers relying on them would notice.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.command-dispatch-handover: false} restores stock Folia
 * refusal for everything this class would have handed off.
