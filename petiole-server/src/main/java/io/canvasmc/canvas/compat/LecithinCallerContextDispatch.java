/**
 * Lecithin: run a rejected sync Bukkit scheduler task on whatever the caller was already working on.
 *
 * <h2>The gap</h2>
 * Paper's {@code scheduleSyncDelayedTask} / {@code runTaskLater} means "run this on the main thread,
 * {@code delay} ticks from now". Folia has no main thread, so it rejects the call outright - and
 * because plugins make these calls from inside event handlers and from {@code onEnable}, the
 * rejection propagates out and kills whatever the plugin was doing. Two measured examples: a claim
 * plugin's one-tick "undo my fake blocks" task took its whole {@code PlayerInteractEvent} handler
 * down with it, and a chat plugin's "make sure we have a sync context" task took chat formatting and
 * delivery down with it.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, and what it deliberately is not</h2>
 * This is a <b>general</b> shim. It has no list of plugins, no jar hashes, no class names and no
 * version locks, and it never looks inside the {@link Runnable} it is handed. It asks
 * {@link LecithinExecutionProvenance} one question - <i>on whose behalf is this thread running</i> -
 * and dispatches to the Folia scheduler that owns the answer:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>region ⇒ {@link org.bukkit.Bukkit#getRegionScheduler()} for that region</li>
 *   <li>global ⇒ {@link org.bukkit.Bukkit#getGlobalRegionScheduler()}</li>
 *   <li>entity ⇒ that entity's own {@link io.papermc.paper.threadedregions.scheduler.EntityScheduler}</li>
 *   <li>nothing known ⇒ <b>rejected exactly as on stock Folia</b>, with the existing diagnostics</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The last line is the important one. Inferring an owner from a bare {@code Runnable} is forbidden
 * and stays forbidden; the point of the provenance model is that in the cases handled here nothing
 * is inferred, because the platform already knew whose work it was.
 *
 * <p>It is also not the "route any rejected sync task to the global region" shim that was tested and
 * rejected earlier: that relocates a region-scoped task onto a thread which owns nothing. Here the
 * global region is used only when the global region is what asked, so no task ever changes context.
 *
 * <h2>Why this cannot make an unsafe task safe, and does not claim to</h2>
 * A task that reaches into another region's state still hits {@code TickThread.ensureTickThread} and
 * still fails, loudly, at the actual access, with the plugin and callsite named. Nothing is
 * swallowed and no ownership check is weakened. What changes is only that a task which was
 * <i>never given a chance to run</i> now runs.
 *
 * <p>Region merge and split are handled by the platform, not here: a region task is scheduled
 * through {@link org.bukkit.Bukkit#getRegionScheduler()}, whose owner is resolved from the chunk key
 * at execution time rather than captured now, and an entity task through Folia's
 * {@code EntityScheduler}, which the platform transfers with the entity across regions and worlds.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code caller-context-dispatch: false} restores stock Folia rejection for
 * everything this class would have redispatched.
