/**
 * Lecithin: during startup the server bootstrap thread <em>is</em> the owner of global server state,
 * so {@code RegionizedServer.ensureGlobalTickThread} must not reject it.
 *
 * <p>Why this is not "bypassing an ownership check": that check exists to serialise writes to global
 * server state against the region threads. On this fork those threads do not exist yet at the point
 * this branch can be reached. {@code MinecraftServer.runServer} is explicit about the order:
 * <pre>
 *   initServer()                          // world loading AND plugin onLoad/onEnable happen here
 *   RegionizedServer.getInstance().init() // region ticking starts only here
 *   LOGGER.info("Done (...)")
 *   for (;;) Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE) // the bootstrap thread never runs anything again
 * </pre>
 * So "the caller is the bootstrap thread" can only mean startup, and during startup it is the only
 * thread touching this state - exactly the situation Paper has on its main thread, where these same
 * plugin calls are the normal, supported thing to do.
 *
 * <p>It also removes a real inconsistency rather than creating one. The bootstrap thread is itself a
 * {@code TickThread} ({@code MinecraftServer} constructs it as one), so on that very thread
 * {@code Bukkit.isPrimaryThread()} - which this platform answers with
 * {@code TickThread.isTickThread()} - already returns {@code true}. A plugin that asks the standard
 * Bukkit question "may I touch server state directly?" is told yes, and was then rejected anyway.
 * That gap is the compatibility bug; this closes it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is per-plugin: there is no plugin name, jar hash or call-site list. Any plugin
 * configuring server state from {@code onEnable} - a very common Bukkit idiom - is covered, and any
 * call made after startup still fails exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.startup-global-context: false} restores the stock rejection.
