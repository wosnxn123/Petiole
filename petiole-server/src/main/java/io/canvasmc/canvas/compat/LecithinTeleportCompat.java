/**
 * Lecithin: restores {@code Entity#teleport(Location, ...)} at the Bukkit API boundary.
 *
 * <h2>The gap</h2>
 * On Paper, {@code Entity#teleport(Location)} moves the entity there and then, on the calling
 * thread, and returns whether it worked. Folia replaces the whole method body with an
 * unconditional {@code throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Must use teleportAsync while in
 * region threading")} - not "throws when it would be unsafe", but <b>always</b>, from every thread,
 * even when the destination is a loaded chunk the calling thread already owns and the move is
 * therefore trivially safe.
 *
 * <p>This is grouped by API symbol, not by plugin, and deliberately so: every Paper plugin that
 * teleports anything calls this method, and there is nothing plugin-specific about the gap or the
 * fix. Anything keyed on plugin names or jar hashes would make "runs any Paper plugin" mean "runs
 * the plugins someone remembered to add to a list".
 *
 * <h2>What this does</h2>
 * Delegate to the platform's own {@link CraftEntity#teleportAsync}, which already resolves region
 * ownership correctly, loads the destination chunk, and hands the entity over between regions and
 * worlds. Then read the resulting future <b>without waiting on it</b>:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Already completed</b> - Folia took its same-region fast path
 *       ({@code Entity#teleportAsync}: same world, this thread owns the destination chunk, chunks
 *       loaded) and performed the move inline. The returned value is the platform's real answer, so
 *       this is Paper's observable behaviour exactly, <i>including</i> {@code false} when the
 *       platform refused (dead entity, has passengers, outside world bounds).</li>
 *   <li><b>Not completed</b> - the destination belongs to another region or another world, or its
 *       chunks are not loaded. Folia cannot move the entity on this thread, and this method must
 *       not wait: the caller <i>is</i> its region's tick, so blocking here stops that region. The
 *       teleport has been accepted and will complete on the owning region's thread, so this reports
 *       {@code true}, and logs once per callsite that the result was deferred.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What it does not do</h2>
 * No ownership or thread-safety check is disabled, bypassed or swallowed - the work is done by the
 * platform's async teleport, which performs all of them. Nothing is dispatched to the global region
 * scheduler, and no owner is guessed from a contextless runnable: the entity itself is the context.
 *
 * <h2>The one bounded semantic difference</h2>
 * In the deferred case the entity is not yet at the destination when the call returns. A caller
 * that teleports and then immediately reads the entity's position sees the old position for up to
 * one tick of the owning region. That difference is the reason for the log line. It is strictly
 * better than the alternative it replaces, which is that the call never works at all: the previous
 * behaviour was not "deferred", it was an exception, and for callers that wrap the teleport in a
 * future (EssentialsX does) the exception was swallowed and the player simply did not move.
 *
 * <p>{@link TeleportFlag}s are passed on to {@code teleportAsync}, which - on Folia - ignores them
 * and always uses {@code TELEPORT_FLAG_LOAD_CHUNK | TELEPORT_FLAG_TELEPORT_PASSENGERS}. That is a
 * pre-existing property of the platform's async teleport, not something introduced here; relative
 * teleport flags are therefore not honoured on this path.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.teleport-semantics: false} restores the stock Folia
 * behaviour, an unconditional throw from both {@code CraftEntity} and {@code CraftPlayer}.
