/**
 * Lecithin: fires the Bukkit teleport events for passengers carried along by a teleported vehicle.
 *
 * <h2>The gap</h2>
 * Teleporting a vehicle moves its whole passenger tree - here and on Paper alike. But the events
 * only follow on Paper. {@link LecithinTeleportEvents} restores the event for the entity actually
 * passed to {@code teleportAsync}; the passengers it drags along get nothing, because the platform
 * moves them through {@code teleportSyncSameRegion} / {@code placeInAsync} rather than through
 * another {@code teleportAsync} call.
 *
 * <p>Measured, same probe on both platforms, teleporting a pig that is carrying an armour stand:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th>case</th><th>Paper 26.2</th><th>this fork, before</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>vehicle + 1 passenger</td><td>2 events (PIG, ARMOR_STAND)</td><td>1 (PIG)</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>vehicle + nested passengers</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>cross region / cross world</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>vehicle carrying a <b>player</b></td><td>1 {@code PlayerTeleportEvent}, cause PLUGIN</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>event cancelled at the vehicle</td><td>1, nothing moves</td><td>1, nothing moves - already matches</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>The player row is the one that matters. A player sitting in a boat, a minecart, a horse or a
 * seat that any plugin teleports crosses the world with <b>no teleport event at all</b>: nothing
 * that vetoes teleports is consulted, and anything watching them sees an unexplained jump instead of
 * a teleport.
 *
 * <h2>🔑 The events are notifications, not veto points - this was measured, not assumed</h2>
 * A handler that cancels a carried passenger's event on Paper is <b>ignored</b>: the passenger still
 * moves and stays mounted. Measured for both event classes separately, because they are different
 * classes and the armour-stand answer does not transfer to the player one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>armour stand, {@code EntityTeleportEvent} cancelled while the pig's is allowed
 *       ⇒ rider still arrives, still mounted;</li>
 *   <li>player, {@code PlayerTeleportEvent} cancelled ⇒ player still arrives, still mounted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * So this ignores cancellation and {@code setTo}, exactly like Paper. That is not a shortcut: the
 * tree moves as one unit, so honouring a single passenger's veto could only produce a half-moved
 * tree - a passenger left behind while its vehicle leaves - which is both a divergence from Paper
 * and the one outcome DEC-59 forbids outright.
 *
 * <h2>What the events carry</h2>
 * The <b>vehicle's</b> {@code from} and {@code to}, for every entity in the tree. That is what the
 * platform actually does to them: every node is moved to the same destination and
 * {@code adjustRiders} then puts the mount offsets back. It also matches Paper exactly on same-world
 * teleports, same region and cross region.
 *
 * <p>Paper's <i>cross-world</i> path reports each passenger's own offset position instead
 * ({@code from} y −57.1 rather than the pig's −58.0, and the same offset on {@code to}). Patch 0035
 * shipped with that as a registered divergence; {@link #CROSS_WORLD_OFFSET} now matches it.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is fired</h2>
 * In {@code Entity#teleportAsync}, immediately after the root entity's own event hook and
 * <b>before</b> the destination's unload read lock is acquired. At that point the tree is still
 * attached, the vehicle has not moved yet, and the root's event has already had its chance to
 * cancel. Firing before the lock means a handler that throws cannot leak it. The only way the
 * teleport can still be refused afterwards is a concurrent level hot-unload - the same exposure the
 * root's event already has.
 *
 * <p>The thread is right by construction: {@code teleportAsync} opens with
 * {@code TickThread.ensureTickThread} on the vehicle, and a mounted passenger is co-located with its
 * vehicle, so it belongs to the same region. Nothing blocks, nothing waits on another region, no
 * ownership check is touched.
 *
 * <p>One hook covers same region, cross region and cross world, because it sits above that branch.
 * Grouped by API symbol, not by plugin: the gap is {@code Entity#teleport} /
 * {@code Entity#teleportAsync} on a vehicle, and nothing here knows what plugins exist.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.passenger-teleport-events: false} restores stock behaviour,
 * which is that carried passengers produce no event. Independent of
 * {@code plugin-compat.teleport-events}, which governs the root entity's event.
