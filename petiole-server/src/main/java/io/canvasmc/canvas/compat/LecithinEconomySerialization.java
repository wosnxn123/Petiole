/**
 * Lecithin: per-account serialization for plugin economy ledgers that were written for a single
 * main thread and have no internal locking of their own.
 *
 * <h2>The problem this exists for</h2>
 * A ledger like EssentialsX's stores the balance in a plain, non-volatile field and mutates it with
 * a non-atomic read-modify-write spread across two method calls
 * ({@code setMoney(getMoney().subtract(x))}). On Paper that is safe by accident: every caller runs
 * on the one main thread, so the operations serialize. On Folia two players in two regions run on
 * two threads, the two read-modify-writes interleave, and one update is lost - then written cleanly
 * to disk by the plugin's own save executor. There is no exception, no log line, and
 * <b>no thread-ownership violation</b>, because a money field is not world state: the whole flow
 * never reaches {@code TickThread.ensureTickThread}. The project's usual "ownership violations = 0"
 * hard metric is structurally blind to it (project-docs evidence 20260729d-t01 section 6.4).
 *
 * <h2>What this class does, and what it deliberately does not</h2>
 * It restores the <i>serialization</i> Paper provided implicitly, at the two boundaries the core
 * actually owns - without touching, patching, or instrumenting a single byte of the plugin:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Service boundary.</b> When any plugin registers a known economy service interface into
 *       Bukkit's {@code ServicesManager}, the provider is wrapped in a {@link Proxy} that holds a
 *       per-account lock for the duration of each call. Every Vault consumer (shop plugins, reward
 *       plugins, server tweaks) goes through this one object, so one wrapper covers all of them.
 *       Different accounts still run fully in parallel - the lock is per account, not global.</li>
 *   <li><b>Legacy command boundary.</b> The plugin's own commands ({@code /pay}, {@code /eco},
 *       {@code /sell}, {@code /balance}) do not go through Vault; they call the plugin's internal
 *       API directly, which the core cannot see. Those are executed under a coarse exclusive lock
 *       that also excludes every service-boundary call above, so the two layers genuinely interlock
 *       instead of each guarding half the ledger.</li>
 * </ol>
 * It does <b>not</b> add a lock inside the plugin, rewrite its data model, or make its balance field
 * volatile - those are {@code DEC-19} B5 and stay out of scope. It also does not, on its own, make
 * any rejected plugin loadable: the {@code DEC-47} refusal list is a separate mechanism and is not
 * touched here.
 *
 * <h2>Lock order and why it cannot deadlock</h2>
 * The only order ever taken is {@code coarse -> account}, and account locks are acquired in sorted
 * key order when a call names more than one account. Nothing is ever held across a scheduler
 * hand-off, a chunk load, or a future - every critical section is a straight-line call into the
 * plugin and back, so a region thread blocked on one of these locks is always waiting on a section
 * that is itself making progress. {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock} permits taking the read lock while
 * already holding the write lock, so a command that internally reaches the service boundary
 * (an economy layer bridging back through Vault) downgrades rather than self-deadlocks.
 *
 * <h2>Fail-open by construction</h2>
 * Unlike {@link LecithinCallerContextDispatch}, which fails <i>closed</i> (an unknown owner means
 * "do not dispatch"), this class fails <i>open</i>: if the service lookup or the
 * proxy construction fails, the original provider is returned unwrapped and the server behaves
 * exactly as it does today. The reason for the difference is that this class never grants a plugin
 * new reach - it only narrows concurrency for a plugin that is already running. A failure here can
 * only lose the added protection, never create a new code path.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.economy-serialization: false} - defaults to <b>on</b>, see
 * {@link #ENABLED} for why this one is not default-off.

     * see. There is no API that says "this command moves money", so the only available signal is the

     * plugins rather than taken from any one of them.

     * <p>What keeps this honest is the second condition: a name here only matters for a plugin that
     * has registered a guarded economy service. A chat plugin owning a command called {@code pay}
     * is not affected, and no plugin is named, versioned or hashed anywhere.
