/**
 * Folia-conformant Bukkit scoreboard support.
 *
 * <p>Folia blocks five scoreboard API methods with an unconditional throw. The implementations
 * behind them are intact; this switch opens them under region-architecture rules instead of
 * single-main-thread rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Plugin-created boards are plain objects. Creation and structural changes broadcast through
 *       netty and a copy-on-write player list, both thread-safe, so any tick thread may do them.
 *   <li>The main scoreboard is global shared state and is persisted. Structural changes to it must
 *       run on the global tick thread - the same thread the vanilla /scoreboard command uses.
 *   <li>Assigning a board to a player is per-player display state and must run on the thread that
 *       owns that player.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Neither check guesses an owner; both only verify the current thread and fail loudly with
 * attribution when it is the wrong one.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   plugin-compat.scoreboard-api: false   # revert to Folia stock: the five methods throw again
