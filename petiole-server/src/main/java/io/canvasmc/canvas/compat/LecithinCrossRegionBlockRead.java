/**
 * Lecithin: serve a <em>read-only</em> block lookup from an already-loaded chunk when the calling
 * tick thread does not own that chunk's region, instead of refusing it.
 *
 * <p>Reading another region's - or another world's - block synchronously is a very common Paper
 * idiom, and on this platform it is not merely inconvenient but structurally impossible to satisfy:
 * every {@code ServerLevel} builds its own regioniser, so a thread ticking a region in world A can
 * never be the tick thread for any chunk in world B. Multiverse's destination scan and its world
 * creation both die on exactly this, and there is no thread the plugin could have used instead.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is narrowing the check rather than disabling it</h2>
 * <p>
 * The blanket refusal in {@code CraftBlock} guards two different things, and only one of them is
 * still real for a read:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Triggering a chunk load off-thread.</b> Real, and kept: this only answers from
 *       {@code getChunkAtIfLoadedImmediately}, and returns {@code null} - so the caller throws
 *       exactly as before - when the chunk is not already resident. Nothing here can load,
 *       generate, or tick a chunk.</li>
 *   <li><b>Racing a concurrent writer on the block data.</b> Upstream has already made this safe.
 *       {@code PalettedContainer.data} is {@code volatile} and every mutator is {@code synchronized};
 *       a resize publishes a brand new {@code Data} rather than editing the old one; and Paper
 *       deliberately disabled the {@code ThreadingDetector} with the comment "use proper
 *       synchronization". A reader therefore takes one consistent snapshot and indexes into it.
 *       {@code LevelChunk.getBlockStateFinal} adds only a bounds check and a plain int read.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * So the worst outcome of a read served here is a block state that is one tick stale - which is the
 * same thing every check-then-act plugin already races against on single-threaded Paper. It cannot
 * throw, cannot deadlock, cannot corrupt, and cannot observe a torn value: entries never span two
 * longs in {@code SimpleBitStorage}, so a concurrent write is seen either wholly or not at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Writes are untouched.</b> {@code CraftBlock}'s "Cannot modify world asynchronously" check and
 * {@code LevelChunk.setBlockState}'s check are exactly as upstream wrote them.
 *
 * <p><b>Tick threads only.</b> Threads that are not tick threads at all - a plugin's own async pool -
 * still fail, so the async catcher keeps working as a diagnostic. Both cases this was written for
 * are tick threads: a region thread reading another world, and the global region thread, which owns
 * no chunks and therefore cannot legally read any block anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is per-plugin: no plugin name, jar hash or call-site list.
 *
 * <p>During startup there is a second case, handled by {@link #readByLoadingDuringStartup}: the chunk
 * is not resident because nobody has asked for it yet. Paper guarantees it would be; Folia does not.
 * That one is restricted to the bootstrap thread - see that method for why it cannot be fixed in
 * {@code prepareLevel} and why it does not widen the rule above.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.cross-region-block-read: false} restores the stock refusal.

    /**
     * Startup only: bring the chunk in and read it, instead of refusing because nobody had asked for
     * it yet.
     *
     * <h2>The invariant this restores</h2>
     * <p>
     * On Paper, {@code MinecraftServer.prepareLevel} activates the world's saved tickets inside
     * {@code ChunkLoadCounter.track(...)} and then spins on {@code executeModerately()} until
     * {@code pendingChunks() == 0}. So by the time any plugin is enabled, the chunks the world's
     * tickets asked for - the spawn area among them - are in memory. Folia deletes both the
     * {@code track} call and the {@code executeModerately} body, leaving a loop with nothing to wait
     * for, and the invariant disappears with it.
     *
     * <p>Reading the world spawn's block in {@code onEnable} is an ordinary thing for a plugin to do,
     * and on Paper it is safe precisely because of that invariant. Without it the read has no legal
     * outcome at all: the chunk is absent, so {@link #readIfResident} cannot answer, and the stock
     * ownership check then throws - every boot, identically, with no way for the plugin to avoid it.
     *
     * <h2>Why the wait is restored here and not in {@code prepareLevel}</h2>
     * <p>
     * Because it structurally cannot be restored there. Region tick threads do not exist yet at that
     * point - {@code RegionizedServer.init()} calls {@code TickRegions.start()} and it runs
     * <em>after</em> {@code initServer()}, which is where plugin enable happens - so anything that
     * needs a region thread to complete a callback would wait forever. That is almost certainly why
     * upstream removed the loop rather than adapting it, and it is why
     * {@code ChunkTaskScheduler.syncLoadNonFull} refuses {@code FULL} outright, with the comment
     * "on Folia, it is required that the non-full load can occur completely asynchronously to avoid
     * deadlock between regions".
     *
     * <p>So this uses the one primitive the platform does sanction, at the one status it sanctions:
     * a <b>non-full</b> synchronous load. {@code MinecraftServer.prepareLevel} already calls exactly
     * this, at exactly this status, on exactly this thread, to find a spawn height - so the pattern
     * is upstream's own, not an invention. The load is performed by the chunk system's worker
     * threads, which run independently of region ticking; this thread parks until they publish it.
     *
     * <p>A chunk at {@code FULL.getParent()} has its sections populated, which is all a block-state
     * read needs. It is not ticking and nothing here makes it tick.
     *
     * <h2>Which threads, and why exactly those</h2>
     * <p>
     * The condition is {@code TickRegionScheduler.getCurrentRegion() == null}: the calling thread is
     * not ticking any region. On this platform that is a closed set of exactly two threads, and both
     * of them own no chunks anywhere:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>the <b>bootstrap thread</b> during startup - and it stops running anything at all once
     *       startup ends;</li>
     *   <li>the <b>global region thread</b>, which by construction owns no chunks in any world. The
     *       class doc above already says a read from it "cannot legally read any block anywhere" -
     *       there is no other thread the caller could have used.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * A thread that <em>is</em> ticking a region takes none of this: it returns {@code null} and gets
     * the stock refusal, so "let any region thread pull in any chunk" stays exactly as closed as it
     * was. That question is {@code D-52} and this does not answer it.
     *
     * <p>The global region case is not speculative and the wait is not novel there either: creating a
     * world at runtime lands in {@code MinecraftServer.setInitialSpawn} on the global region thread,
     * and upstream's own {@code PlayerSpawnFinder.getLevelRespawnPos} calls this same
     * {@code syncLoadNonFull} from it. Measured 2026-08-04d: it parks about 5s - long enough for the
     * watchdog to log "Global region has not responded" - and then completes. So the platform already
     * pays this cost on this thread; what it does not do is let the plugin's own follow-up read
     * succeed afterwards.
     *
     * <h2>The cost, named</h2>
     * <p>
     * This blocks the calling thread until the chunk is published. On the bootstrap thread that is
     * free - nothing else is running. On the global region thread it is not: the region's tick is
     * stalled for the duration, and the watchdog logs "Global region has not responded" past 5s.
     * The first read of an area pays it and the rest do not, because the chunk is resident
     * afterwards and {@link #readIfResident} answers them - so a plugin scanning a spawn area pays
     * per chunk, not per block.
     *
     * <p>A plugin that scanned a large area of cold chunks from the global region would stall it
     * repeatedly, and there is no cap here. That is deliberate rather than overlooked: the only
     * alternative is the read being impossible, which is where this started. If it ever becomes a
     * real problem the shape of the fix is a budget per tick, not a plugin list.
     *
     * <p>Nothing here is per-plugin, and it does not widen {@link #readIfResident} for writes or for
     * non-tick threads. The same kill switch turns it off.
     *
     * @return the block state, or {@code null} to let the caller apply the stock ownership check
