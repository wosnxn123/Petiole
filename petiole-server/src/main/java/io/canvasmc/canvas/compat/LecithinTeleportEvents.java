/**
 * Lecithin: fires the Bukkit teleport events that Folia left as a TODO.
 *
 * <h2>The gap</h2>
 * On Paper every semantic teleport goes through {@code Entity#teleport(TeleportTransition)} or
 * {@code ServerPlayer#teleport(TeleportTransition)}, and those two methods are where
 * {@code EntityTeleportEvent}, {@code PlayerTeleportEvent} and {@code PlayerChangedWorldEvent} are
 * fired. Folia replaces both method bodies with an unconditional
 * {@code if (true) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Must use teleportAsync while in region
 * threading")} and routes everything through {@code Entity#teleportAsync} instead - where, at the
 * point the events used to be fired, it leaves the literal comment
 * {@code // TODO any events that can modify go HERE}. Luminol later added its own
 * {@code EntityTeleportAsyncEvent} at exactly that comment, but did not restore the Bukkit ones.
 *
 * <p>Measured consequence (Paper 26.2 vs this fork, same script, same counting plugin, same vanilla
 * commands): Paper fires {@code PlayerTeleportEvent} 3x and {@code PlayerChangedWorldEvent} 2x; the
 * fork fires 0 and 0, while the teleports themselves happen. Plugins that veto teleports
 * (GriefPrevention) or observe them (anti-cheat) are simply never told.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is grouped by API symbol, not by plugin</h2>
 * The gap is three Bukkit event symbols, not a plugin. Every Paper plugin that listens for a
 * teleport is affected identically, and nothing here knows or can know which plugins those are.
 *
 * <h2>Where the events are fired</h2>
 * {@code Entity#teleportAsync} calls this <b>after</b> its validity checks (spawnable bounds,
 * {@code canTeleportAsync}, passenger constraints) and <b>before</b> it acquires the destination's
 * unload lock or mutates any state. That single point has all four properties the event needs:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Correct thread.</b> {@code teleportAsync} opens with
 *       {@code TickThread.ensureTickThread(this, ...)}, so the caller already owns this entity's
 *       region. Reading {@code from} and firing the handler is done on the thread Bukkit's
 *       synchronous event contract expects. Nothing blocks and nothing waits on another region.</li>
 *   <li><b>Cancellation is free.</b> Nothing has been mutated yet, so a cancelled event is a plain
 *       {@code return false} - the same value {@code teleportAsync} already returns for its own
 *       refusals. Upstream does the same thing a few methods away with Luminol's
 *       {@code PreEntityPortalEvent}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Before the branch.</b> It sits above the same-region/cross-region split, so one hook
 *       covers same region, cross region and cross world.</li>
 *   <li><b>No lock to unwind.</b> Firing before {@code levelUnloadStateLock.acquireRead()} means a
 *       cancel cannot leak that read lock.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Which teleports fire an event</h2>
 * Every {@code teleportAsync} call whose {@link TeleportCause} is not {@code UNKNOWN}.
 * {@code UNKNOWN} is what Folia and Luminol pass for their own internal repositioning, which has no
 * Paper counterpart and must not look like a teleport to plugins:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Entity#fixPassengerDesync} - a Folia-only correction of a desynced passenger.</li>
 *   <li>{@code Level#guardEntityTick} - Luminol's recovery when an entity moved itself out of its
 *       region mid-tick.</li>
 *   <li>{@code TamableAnimal#maybeTeleportTo} - fires {@code EntityTeleportEvent} itself and
 *       <i>then</i> schedules the {@code teleportAsync}; firing again here would double it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Everything with a real cause is a teleport Paper would also have reported: {@code COMMAND}
 * (vanilla {@code /tp}), {@code ENDER_PEARL}, {@code END_GATEWAY}, {@code NETHER_PORTAL},
 * {@code END_PORTAL}, and {@code PLUGIN} (the Bukkit API, whose {@code teleport}/{@code teleportAsync}
 * overloads all default to {@code PLUGIN}).
 *
 * <p><b>The one divergence this rule creates:</b> a plugin that explicitly passes
 * {@code TeleportCause.UNKNOWN} to {@code teleportAsync} gets no event, where Paper would fire one.
 * No API overload produces {@code UNKNOWN} by default, so this requires the caller to ask for it.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not do</h2>
 * No ownership check is disabled, bypassed or swallowed; nothing is dispatched to the global region
 * scheduler; no owner is guessed. The event handler runs on the region that owns the entity, exactly
 * like every other event Folia fires. A handler that reaches into the <i>destination</i> region from
 * here will fail its own ownership check - that is the platform's existing rule, not a new one, and
 * it is the same failure Paper handlers never see because Paper has one thread.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code plugin-compat.teleport-events: false} restores stock behaviour, which is
 * that none of these three events is ever fired.
